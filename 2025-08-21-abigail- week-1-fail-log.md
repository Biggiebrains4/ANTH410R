# Week 1 fail log
Week 1 I set up my D2L profile, my perusall, and my GitHub blog. I have to admit I am not good at technology but the intructions helped. I am mostly concerned for the smaller aspects of this class that I am unfamiliar with like coding, filing, etc. It is kind of intimidating but I will try my best to ask questions and understand the content. I think today was overwhelming while learning all the new softwares/ websites and grasping the instructions correctly.
