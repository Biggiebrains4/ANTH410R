# Week 1 fail log
Week 1 I set up my D2L profile, my perusall, and my GitHub blog. I have to admit I am not good at technology but the intructions helped. I am mostly concerned for the smaller aspects of this class that I am unfamiliar with like coding, filing, etc. It is kind of intimidating but I will try my best to ask questions and understand the content. I think today was overwhelming while learning all the new softwares/ websites and grasping the instructions correctly. 
## Week 4 fail log
Okay, every week I update this and it never saves so I guess well see if it saves this week. I really had no issues this week besides a little confusion when starting off on OneNote. I also thought the readings were informative, relevant, and easy to apply to the course. 
## Week 5 fail log
This week I really didn't have to many issues again besides my Wifi. I am in the process of trying to switch my wifi due to an unstable connection so it made some of the websites and links not fully load. On a good note I think I've finally mastered my fail log, seeing as Week 4 is still visible and wasn't deleted.
