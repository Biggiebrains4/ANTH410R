# Week 1 fail log
Week 1 I set up my D2L profile, my perusall, and my GitHub blog. I have to admit I am not good at technology but the intructions helped. I am mostly concerned for the smaller aspects of this class that I am unfamiliar with like coding, filing, etc. It is kind of intimidating but I will try my best to ask questions and understand the content. I think today was overwhelming while learning all the new softwares/ websites and grasping the instructions correctly. 
## Week 4 fail log
Okay, every week I update this and it never saves so I guess well see if it saves this week. I really had no issues this week besides a little confusion when starting off on OneNote. I also thought the readings were informative, relevant, and easy to apply to the course. 
## Week 5 fail log
This week I really didn't have to many issues again besides my Wifi. I am in the process of trying to switch my wifi due to an unstable connection so it made some of the websites and links not fully load. On a good note I think I've finally mastered my fail log, seeing as Week 4 is still visible and wasn't deleted. 
## week 6
This week I did some research to prepare a topic for my Capstone project. I was a little confused on the project at first until I discovered the assignment instructions on Perusall. I struggles a bit to think of a good topic, and decided to go with the correlation between migration and the economy. For the Data Dictionary... I'm not sure what is wrong with my brain but I could not understand a single bit of what I was looking at. I tried going through videos and other blogs about it, but in the end I accepted the fact that I simply have a giant weakness for spreadsheets or anything similar to that matter. Definitely something I need to strengthen if I ever decide to invilve myself with technological anthropology again.
## Week 10 Fail Log
This week I really didn't struggle with anything in the checklist. I have been struggling in this class as I haven't been active in 3 weeks so I am really trying to get myself back into the habit of checking due dates and being prepared for upcoming assignments and projects. I did struggle a little with the 3rd check in since I've been MIA, but I think it caused me to reflect on the work I did before my hiatus, so it helped me touch on the past course content I did and warmed my brain up.
