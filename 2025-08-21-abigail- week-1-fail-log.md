# Week 1 fail log
Week 1 I set up my D2L profile, my perusall, and my GitHub blog. I have to admit I am not good at technology but the intructions helped. I am mostly concerned for the smaller aspects of this class that I am unfamiliar with like coding, filing, etc. It is kind of intimidating but I will try my best to ask questions and understand the content. I think today was overwhelming while learning all the new softwares/ websites and grasping the instructions correctly. 
## Week 4 fail log
Okay, every week I update this and it never saves so I guess well see if it saves this week. I really had no issues this week besides a little confusion when starting off on OneNote. I also thought the readings were informative, relevant, and easy to apply to the course. 
## Week 5 fail log
This week I really didn't have to many issues again besides my Wifi. I am in the process of trying to switch my wifi due to an unstable connection so it made some of the websites and links not fully load. On a good note I think I've finally mastered my fail log, seeing as Week 4 is still visible and wasn't deleted. 
## week 6
This week I did some research to prepare a topic for my Capstone project. I was a little confused on the project at first until I discovered the assignment instructions on Perusall. I struggles a bit to think of a good topic, and decided to go with the correlation between migration and the economy. For the Data Dictionary... I'm not sure what is wrong with my brain but I could not understand a single bit of what I was looking at. I tried going through videos and other blogs about it, but in the end I accepted the fact that I simply have a giant weakness for spreadsheets or anything similar to that matter. Definitely something I need to strengthen if I ever decide to invilve myself with technological anthropology again.
## Week 10 Fail Log
This week I really didn't struggle with anything in the checklist. I have been struggling in this class as I haven't been active in 3 weeks so I am really trying to get myself back into the habit of checking due dates and being prepared for upcoming assignments and projects. I did struggle a little with the 3rd check in since I've been MIA, but I think it caused me to reflect on the work I did before my hiatus, so it helped me touch on the past course content I did and warmed my brain up. 
## Week 12
I didn't run into too many issues this week with the weekly assignments, however I was having some trouble navigating my Capstone project so I met with Professor Stantis and voiced my questions and concerns, which helped tremendessly with easing my nerves but also helping me build a confident plan of my zine. I did have a bit of trouble staying engaged with some parts of the reading on Perusall due to the length of it and all the in-text citations, but I broke it up into 2 days which allowed me to refocus on the theme of the piece. 
## Week 13
The only issues I really had this week was transcribing the Dunham papers for a few different reasons. My head felt like it was going to explode with how much I was squinting at the screen of my laptop, the graphite on the paper was smudged from handling so many of the pages had a bad contrast between the pencil smeared everywhere along with a light background. I also felt as tho the cursive was a bit sloppy, with many lines having overlapped on the sentence surrounding it, making it hard to decipher which lines belonged where. The french words (i assume perhaps) and the names were hardest to transcribe because there was not a lot of context behind it, and my wifi was being crappy so everytime I'd try to look at the records of archives for clues my computer would crash. Some of her letters were also questionable and being such a long time ago, the dialect was also tricky to out together. Although I struggles a bit, I thought it was a really fun excersize and I felt like the detective in the movie Zodiac with RDJ, so I feel it was useful, a good skill to practice, and interactive in a different way we haven't seen to often I don' think.
## Week 14
No issues this week so far, I just need to do my readings on Perusall, which I will update this after that's complete. I will admit trandlating smell and touch were kind of difficult for me.
