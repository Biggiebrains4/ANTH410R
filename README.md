Hi, I'm BiggieBrains and I am a senior studying anthropology at Southern Illinois University. My interests include archaeology, cultural anthropology, bioanthropology, and forensic anthropology. I think I enjoy learning about cultural anthropological topics more than the others, but I enjoy being in the field doing archaeological digs and excavations. My passion lies in learning about shared experiences and theories of evolution/ human experience.
