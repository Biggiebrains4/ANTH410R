# example_fail-log_craftingDH

This GitHub repository is an example fail log for the ANTHXXX Empowering Anthropological Research in the Digital Age. The point of a fail log is to openly discuss your worries, pose questions, and reflect on your weekly learning. Dr. Stantis will review your fail log and offer individual or class-wide feedback. Note that while this work can seem daunting, a fail log will help generate open discussion and track your educational growth. The log is meant to help document your work. Remember: **Document what you do, and do what you document.**

In the first week of the course, you will fork this repository to begin curating a weekly fail log. 

## Update your fail log

Follow the instructions below to create your first example fail log:

1. Navigate to the [root of this GitHub repository](https://github.com/stantis/example_fail_log_anth).
2. At the top right of the page, click the button labelled ``Fork``.
3. Rename this repo ``ANTH410R``. 
4. You will now notice that the top left resembles the following - this means you now have your own copy of the fail log to get started:
````
YourUsername\ANTH410R
forked from stantis\example_fail_log_anth
````
4. In your new forked repository, open the file ``2025-02-06-week-1-fail-log.md``.
5. Change the date in the file title to today's date (using the YYYY-MM-DD convention). You may also wish to change the ``week-1-fail-log`` to something more descriptive. 
6. Each week you will include a link to your 3 most important Perusall annotations and reflect on how the 3 annotations were meaningful to your learning. Make use of Markdown language to make your documentation easier to read. 
7. In the first week you will also reflect on your worries for the course, any technical issues you encountered, etc.
8. In later weeks, this repo will also serve as a way to show me what you've done for the week (note: you're still welcome to also include any technical issues you encountered etc.).   

You can also edit this main file (``README.md``) in your forked copy of the repository to contain a summary of your fail logs. The README file is the first file people read when they visit your repository. To edit this file, follow the instruction below:

1. Click the ``README.md`` file to open it.
2. To the right of the button group labelled ``Raw``, ``Blame``, and ``History``, click the pen/pencil icon to edit the ``README.md`` file. ``README.md`` is a Markdown (.md) file. For more information on the Markdown syntax, read [Daring Fireball's instroduction to Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). We'll cover Markdown in-depth later.
3. Change the title text to something relevant.
4. Delete all these instructions and add a relevant summary of your fail logs. You can continue updating this file.

## Create a new file in GitHub in the browser

Each week you will create a new fail log file at the root of your forked repository. To create a new file in your GitHub repository, follow the instructions below:

1. At the root of your repository, click the button labelled ``Create new file``. For reference, visit [GitHub's instructional guide for creating new files](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-new-files).
2. Title your file to resemble the following: ``2025-02-13-week-2-fail-log.md``. **Always title your file with the date first (using the YYYY-MM-DD convention)**.
3. This creates a new markdown (.md) file. 
4. Add your fail log for that week.
5. At the bottom of the file, enter a brief 'commit' message about what you updated.
6. Click the green button at the bottom labelled ``Commit new file``.

## Create a new folder in GitHub in the browser

You may also wish to organize each week into separate folders. That way you can add more files for each week. For example, for Week 2 you have your fail log and the document that you practiced working with Zotero on. Adding a new folder is just as simple as adding a new file in your GitHub repository. Follow the instructions below:

1. At the root of your repository, click the button labelled ``Create new file``. For reference, visit [GitHub's instructional guide for creating new files](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-new-files).
2. **However**, in this case you type your folder name followed by a slash ``/``. This will create the new folder.
3. Then you type the file name. For reference, visit [KirstieJane's instructions on creating a new folder in GitHub](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Creating-new-folders-in-GitHub-repository-via-the-browser).
4. Add your text to the new file.
5. At the bottom of the file, enter a brief 'commit' message about what you updated.
6. Click the green button at the bottom labelled ``Commit new file``.
