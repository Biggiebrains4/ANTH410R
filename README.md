## Week 1 
  Hi, I'm BiggieBrains and I am a senior studying anthropology at Southern Illinois University. My interests include archaeology, cultural anthropology, bioanthropology, and forensic anthropology. I think I enjoy learning about cultural anthropological topics more than the others, but I enjoy being in the field doing archaeological digs and excavations. My passion lies in learning about shared experiences and theories of evolution/ human experience. 
## Week 2
  For week 2 we got started on Research Rabbit and learned how to create a collection and connect to our public class collection. We also explored google scholar a bit and saw the benefits of that search engine compared to regular search engines like google or bing. We also learned about using the Morris Library website on Salukinet to help us find books/ articles/ sources to help research in a scholarly way. 
## Week 3 
  I thought the Stanford Seminar about the magic of technology was very captivating, and definitely introduced me to some theories, topics, and history that I had previously never heard or thought of. I really loved her lesson she did about the watch/clocks and how thanks to technology, we were able to personalize time, and then we personalized the world around us with the invention of the telescope and microscope. I thought it was very helpful in understanding the relationship between history and technology, and how not only the world is different because of technology, but the way we perceive life and the grand scheme of things is vastly different than the mindsets people had in the 1600's. I also really enjoyed the second reading on Perusall. I can't lie, the first article was an extremely tough read for me, and I found myself struggling to grasp any information from it. However, "Technology and History" was another good lesson on the relationship between technology and society. After the first few pages, I found myself understanding more about the intricate role technology and machinery have in shaping the world, and how technology can have answers for one place, but not another: like the DDT that was harmful in western countries but impressively helped India bring down cases of Malaria. Both went hand in hand in describing the different views on technology and how its role has been both detrimental and beneficial at times. I was unable to access the public library on Zotero, but once I can access it I will update this blog. From the time I was able to mess around on Zotero and the tutorial, it seems like a beneficial software for researching and I am excited to understand it better.
