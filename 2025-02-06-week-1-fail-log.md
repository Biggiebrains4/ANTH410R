# Week 1 fail log
Admittedly, I had a difficult first week. I was able to create my GitHub and Perusall accounts but there were a few hiccups (that I annotated using Perusall).   
I am a bit concerned about diving into GitHub next week, but I see there are instruction videos which I imagine will help a lot!
## Week 3 Fail Log 
  I am still struggling a bit to get the hang of some of the different softwares, seeing as I failed to properly save my fail log for Week 2. This week I felt as though I struggled quite a bit during different activities, such as the first reading on Perusall "The Medium is the Message", I don't know if  it was maybe a higher vocabulary level than what I'm used to or if I simply didn't know anyhting prior really to what I was reading. It was hard to make connections and grasp along to what the text was trying to teach me. The next thing I struggled with was the Group Library on Zotero, I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but as of now I cannot access it. I will try to ask my peers and see if any of them could help me access it. 
  I hope by the end of this next week I will have a better grasp on things.
